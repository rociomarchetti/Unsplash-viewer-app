Application that connects to the unsplash.com API to upload and display an image layout.

> Brief description of the project: 

 The selection of images is random and is renewed with each click of the button. By clicking on each image we can access to a modal that shows it in an enlarged form. If the image provided by the api contains a description of the image, it appears as a footer inside the modal.
